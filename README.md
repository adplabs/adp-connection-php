## ADP Marketplace Partners

There are a few pre-requesites that you need to fullfill in order to use this library:
- Replace the certifcates in this library with the ones you recieved from the [CSR Tool](https://apps.adp.com/apps/165104)
- Update the client id and client secret with the ones supplied in your credentials document PDF
- Update endpoints from ```https://iat-api.adp.com``` and ```https://iat-accounts.adp.com``` to  ```https://api.adp.com``` and ```https://accounts.adp.com```.

# ADP Client Connection Library for PHP

The ADP Client Connection Library is intended to simplify and aid the process of authenticating, authorizing and connecting to the ADP Marketplace API Gateway. The Library includes a sample application that can be run out-of-the-box to connect to the ADP Marketplace API **test** gateway.

### Version
1.0.3

### Installation

**Composer**

Use Composer from the location you wish to use as the root folder for your project.

```sh
$ composer require adpmarketplace/api-connection
```

This will install the Connection module to your project.  If you wish to build the sample client, do the following:

```sh
$ cd adplib/connection/tools
$ php makeclient.php
```

If you want to test immediately, copy and paste the proper commands that are generated by the makeclient.php script.  In case you missed them, you can do it this way as well:

```sh
(from the project root)
$ cd client
$ php -S 127.0.0.1:8889
```

This starts an HTTP server on port 8889 (this port must be unused to run the sample application).

**Run the sample app**

Note, to test the sample app you must first run the makeclient.php script, and then start the PHP server as outlined above.

Once this is done, open your web browser and go to:

```sh
http://localhost:8889
```

 The sample app allows you to connect to the ADP test API Gateway using the **client_credentials** and **authorization_code** grant types. For the **authorization_code** connection, you will be asked to provide an ADP username (MKPLDEMO) and password (marketplace1).

## Examples
### Create Client Credentials ADP Connection

```php

require_once ("config.php"); // Contains settings
require_once ($libroot . "connection/adpapiConnection.class.php");


//----------------------
// Create Config Array
//----------------------

$configuration = array (
        'grantType'             => 'client_credentials',
        'clientID'              => $ADP_CC_CLIENTID,
        'clientSecret'          => $ADP_CC_CLSECRET,
        'sslCertPath'           => $ADP_CERTFILE,
        'sslKeyPath'            => $ADP_KEYFILE,
        'tokenServerURL'        => $ADP_APIROOT
    );

//----------------------
// Create the class
//----------------------

try {

    $adpConn = adpapiConnectionFactory::create($configuration);

}
catch (adpException $e) {

    showADPException($e);
    exit();

}

//-------------------------------------------
// Request a token for API access
//-------------------------------------------

try {

    $result = $adpConn->Connect();
}
catch (adpException $e) {

    showADPException($e);
    exit();

}

```

### Create Authorization Code ADP Connection

The Authorization Code requires 2 pieces.  The first piece handles the creation of the request URI to be sent to the gateway.  The second piece handles the response from the gateway and uses it to retrieve an access token.

Generating the request URI:

```php

require_once ("config.php"); // Contains settings
require_once ($libroot . "connection/adpapiConnection.class.php");

//----------------------
// Create Config Array
//----------------------

$configuration = array (
        'grantType'             => 'authorization_code',
        'clientID'              => $ADP_AC_CLIENTID,
        'clientSecret'          => $ADP_AC_CLSECRET,
        'sslCertPath'           => $ADP_CERTFILE,
        'sslKeyPath'            => $ADP_KEYFILE,
        'tokenServerURL'        => $ADP_APIROOT,
        'scope'                 => 'openid',
        'responseType'          => 'code',
        'redirectURL'           => $ADP_REDIRECTURL
    );


//----------------------
// Create the class
//----------------------

try {
    $adpConn = adpapiConnectionFactory::create($configuration);
}
catch (adpException $e) {

    showADPException($e);
    exit();

}

//-----------------------------------------------
// Request an authentication URL from Connection
//-----------------------------------------------

try {

    $result = $adpConn->getAuthRequest();
}
catch (adpException $e) {

    showADPException($e);
    exit();

}

//-----------------------------------------------
// Send the browser to the generated URI
//-----------------------------------------------

header("Location: " . $result);

```

And the second part, when the gateway returns to us:

```php

require ($webroot . "config.php");
require ($libroot . "connection/adpapiConnection.class.php");

// Check to see if there is an error

if (isset($_GET['error'])) {

    echo "<h1>Gateway Error</h1>";
    echo "<div class='alert alert-danger'>\n";
    echo "The error returned is: " . $_GET['error'];
    echo "</div>\n";
    exit();

}


// Get the authorization code, if available.

$retcode = $_GET['code'];

// restore session object from session.  Handle sessions the way you see fit.
$adpConn = unserialize($_SESSION['adpConn']);

//--------------------------------------------------
// Add the returned code to the connection object
//--------------------------------------------------


$adpConn->auth_code         = $retcode;

//-------------------------------------------
// Request a token for API access
//-------------------------------------------

try {
    $result = $adpConn->Connect();
}
catch (adpException $e) {

    showADPException($e);
    exit();

}


```
